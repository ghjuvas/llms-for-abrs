# Large language models for aspect-based review summarization
Program code containing studies conducted as a part of thesis dedicated to aspect-based review summarization

## About
This study is dedicated to aspect-based summarization. I fine-tuned LLMs ruBERT, mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa on reviews about restaurants and automobiles. There are two solutions to make summaries: use one of the model as a pair classificator or as a sequence tagger. Finally, there is clusterisation to obtain the result.

## Technical
